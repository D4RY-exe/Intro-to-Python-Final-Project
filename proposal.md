# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Park Bench

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Story RPG using Godot and potentially Blender.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our team would like to create a video game in Godot that is largely text based with 2D animated sprites. Ideally, the game would have 3D elements that would be created/imported from blender and programmed to be animated/become an interactive space for the character to move around in. Very few scenes would include this 3D element as realistically it will be very time consuming to create. The main aspects we would like to focus on in the video game’s story is ability to be controlled/movement, a strong story line that includes topics of existentialism and psychological horror, and programmed textures. Because we are all beginners with both Godot and Blender, we are still flexible within our ideas.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Vee Wien – sara.wien@temple.edu – TA: Chong Li
Isabel Gallard – isabel.gallard@temple.edu – TA: Xinwen Zhang
Dary Demchuk – dary.demchuk@temple.edu – TA: Xinwen Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

To make a short, hopefully playable game with decent graphics.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A demo/prototype of the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

3D graphics and around 10-15 minutes of gameplay.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps, at this current point, would be to meet and assess what each person is interested in contributing to the game, and to write the script. We would all need to become familiar with Godot, as well as draw outlines for scenes we would like to create in blender. What this looks like in practice is just researching tutorials for how to reach our general imagined goal and to figure out what we can reasonably do with our abilities and timeframe. The rest will be meeting up (in person and online) to put together the different aspects we each out be working on.
